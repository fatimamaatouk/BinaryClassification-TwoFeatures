This code implements logistic regression models to predict student exam pass/fail based on two exam scores

# Logistic Regression for Exam Pass/Fail Prediction

This project demonstrates logistic regression for binary classification, predicting whether a student will pass or fail based on their exam scores.

## Features

* **Linear and Polynomial Logistic Regression:** Implementation of both linear and polynomial models.
* **Gradient Descent:** Training using gradient descent optimization.
* **Accuracy Calculation:** Evaluation of model performance using accuracy metric.
* **Decision Boundary Visualization:** Plotting decision boundaries to understand model behavior.
* **Testing:** Evaluation of the final model on a separate test set.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset named 'exam_scores.csv' containing exam scores and pass/fail labels.

## Usage

1. **Load the dataset:** Ensure the 'exam_scores.csv' file is in the correct directory.
2. **Run the code:** Execute the code cells in the provided Jupyter Notebook.
3. **Observe results:** Analyze the accuracy scores and decision boundary visualizations for both models.

## Dependencies

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scipy
